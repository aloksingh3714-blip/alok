•	Understanding Light-Dependent Resistors (LDRs): Learners grasp the core principle of a photoresistor—its resistance is inversely proportional to light intensity.
•	Applying Voltage Dividers: The project provides a practical application for a voltage divider circuit, a foundational concept in electronics.
•	Analog Input Processing: Students learn how to read and interpret analog sensor data using the analogRead() function and the Arduino's ADC.
•	Serial Communication: The use of the Serial Monitor to view real-time data from the sensor is a key learning outcome for debugging and understanding sensor behavior.
•	Creating Light-Activated Systems: This project serves as a building block for more complex applications, such as automatic night lights, burglar alarms, or ambient light-controlled systems.
